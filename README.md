## Hi there 👋

My name is Liam, I'm an 18 year old student studying Information Technology, I'm hoping to pursue a career in Information Technology after I graduate!
I've been coding since I was 14, I'm proficient in JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, and Lua.
I'm interested in learning Swift so I can write iOS apps.

Thanks for checking out my profile!
